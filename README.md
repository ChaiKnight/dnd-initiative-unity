# dnd-initiative-unity

A simple DnD initiative tracker made in Unity for DMs such as myself.

# Introduction

This is a Unity project. It allows you to track your DnD players' initiative.

## How do I use it?

You can either download the source code and mess around with it yourself or download a build found under [Releases](https://github.com/ChaiKnight/dnd-initiative-unity/releases).
The program itself is super simple, and with any amount of experience DM'ing combats the options should be fairly obvious.

## How can I help?

This is a Unity project, notorious for being hell on earth to cooporate with using anything but Unity collab. 
If you are very serious about helping out, message me and we'll figure something out.
